#### Graphs are everywhere, byt why?

```python
The earliest known paper in this field is the famous
Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg written by Leonhard Euler in 1736.
```

```python
Most data is unstructured and unlabelled
```

```python
Structural organization of observations/entities can be
recovered and studied using graphs
```

```javascript
Predictions on unseen data can be generated on graphs directly
or in the original data-domain using conventional "AI"
```

#### Interpretability is a problem?

```python
Conventional "AI" applied to problems in experimental natural
sciences, especially in chemistry provides high predictive
capacity, but have very little descriptive power
```

```markdown
What to do when you don't know yourself which
data can be relied upon?
```

```python
Black box AI is any artificial intelligence system whose
inputs and operations are not visible to the user or
another interested party
```

#### Human tools are still valuable?

```python
Visual graph intelligence with your big or complex data?
Can It automatically transforms your data into interactive,
visual maps built for the needs of analysts
```
